# typescript-react-boilerplate

## Issue

1. [react-hot-loader state lost issue](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/923)

    You have to use babel-loader and `react-hot-loader/babel` to persist the state.

1. Please note that with `transpileOnly` mode, declaration files aren't generated by the Typescript compiler...

1. tweak tsconfig.json

1. tweak vscode debug configs
